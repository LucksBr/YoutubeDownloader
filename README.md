# YoutubeDownloader
Project that simulates a small server to download videos from YouTube - GoLang.

The idea is to create a server that receives a YouTube link and returns the video or audio options.
And, after selecting these options, they are sent back for download to the backend.

Why this project?

It's a pain having to use the conversion sites currently available online; they always leave something to be desired. Whether it's corrupted videos, videos without audio (due to YouTube's recent separation of these tracks), or the video not even being available for download.
